<span class="parent"><div class="child">Cooking your own meals is often the best choice for several compelling reasons.</div> 
    <div class="child">First, it allows you to have complete control over the ingredients, ensuring that you can use fresh, healthy, and high-quality components tailored to your dietary needs and preferences. </div>
<div class="child">This can lead to better nutrition and overall health. Additionally, cooking at home is usually more cost-effective than dining out, as you save on the markup costs associated with restaurant meals. Moreover, the act of cooking can be a fulfilling and enjoyable activity that fosters creativity and provides a sense of accomplishment. </div>
